It is a multi-faceted institution: an educational institution, an international university of musical arts and a concert centre. It brings our music heritage to the fore whilst holding true to its spirit of openness, creativity and innovation and its European and international character.</p>             <p>The Academy is housed in a 1907 building by Fl칩ris Korb and K치lman Giergl, which is considered to be a masterpiece of Hungarian Secession. It integrates inter alia the Liszt Ferenc Memorial Museum and Research Centre, the Kod치ly Institute and the Kod치ly Museum.</p>"
