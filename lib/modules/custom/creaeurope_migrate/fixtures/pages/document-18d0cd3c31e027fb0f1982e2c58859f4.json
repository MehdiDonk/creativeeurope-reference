Later, it hosted people returning to the Netherlands from the former Dutch colony of the East Indies, among them a large group of Moluccans.</p>             <p>Thanks to its history, Camp Westerbork has links to crucial topics in European history such as occupation, persecution, migration, decolonisation and multiculturalism.</p>             <p>A museum (providing, among other activities, educational programmes) and monuments of remembrance (such as the National Westerbork Memorial) can today be found on the site of the former camp.</p>             <p>Find out more about the selection of the site from <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/actions/heritage-label/documents/2013-panel-report_en.pdf#page=8\">the panel's report</a>.</p>"
