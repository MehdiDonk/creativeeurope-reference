With his declaration of 9 May 1950, commemorated annually as Europe Day, he laid the foundations for the European Coal and Steel Community and for all the European institutions to come.</p>             <p>He bought the <a href=\"http://www.maison-robert-schuman.eu/\" target=\"_blank\"                   title=\"Link to Maison Robert Schuman website\">house</a> in 1926 and, from 1960 onwards, spent the years of his retirement there. Today it hosts a museum and contains many objects that belonged to Robert Schuman and which prove his attachment to the European ideal.</p>             <p>Find out more about the selection of the site from <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/actions/heritage-label/documents/2014-panel-report.pdf#page=17\">the panel's report</a>.</p>"
