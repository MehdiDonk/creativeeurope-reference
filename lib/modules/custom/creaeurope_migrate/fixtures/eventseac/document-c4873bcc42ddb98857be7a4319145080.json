        "<h4>The Enchanted City</h4>             <p>01.08. &gt; 30.08.2015</p>             <p>August will start out as the month of the circus. With Compagnie XY and its poetic human structures, twenty-two acrobats will fly over a Grand-Place full of surprising musical swings. But the August festival in Mons will have even more creativity spilling out into the streets, a fantastic vintage amusement park for families (featuring the garden cabin seen above), an armada of show barges at the Grand Large and, of course, a firework display.</p>             <h4>Compagnie XY – Opening of the Festival</h4>             <p>Grand-Place</p>             <p>01.08.15&gt; 02.08.2015 - 08:00 PM</p>             <p>Free</p>             <h4>Lyrical Minutes in the City</h4>             <p>Ensemble Leporello</p>             <p>Music street theatre piétonnier</p>             <p>06.08.15 &gt; 07.08.2015 – During the day<br/>Free</p>             <p>Generally speaking, cities are jam-packed places with masses of people, who go on living their everyday lives in search of balance between their own peace and quiet, grocery shopping, running their errands, arriving to their appointments on time and experiencing some pleasant moments in the meantime. The crammed urban living arrangement also has a good side to it, since it always leaves some room for surprise in the city. Come by at the spots we chose for you in Mons and let yourself experience something utterly unexpected and amazing. Various people and places are up for a big surprise, since they will be taken away by the lyrical moments, sprouting out of thin air in front of the visitors and thus making the city such an interesting place to live in despite the hardships it brings along.
