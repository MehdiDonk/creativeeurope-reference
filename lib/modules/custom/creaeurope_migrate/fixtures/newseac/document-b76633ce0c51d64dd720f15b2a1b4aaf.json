        "<p>The level of the competition was very high, with 47 applications received and a threshold for funding fixed at 84/100 (instead of 72 in 2014). The budget available for EU platforms in 2015 amounts to 3.4 million EUR. Details of the 3 selected projects can be found on <a href=\"https://eacea.ec.europa.eu/sites/eacea-site/files/selection_results-including_members.pdf\"                   target=\"_blank\"                   title=\"Details of selected projects\">the website of the EAC Executive Agency</a>.</p>             <p>A European Platform project consist of a minimum of 10 members (festivals, venues, libraries, theatres, etc.) which together make the commitment to promote and showcase emerging talent, providing mobility and visibility, in particular to those lacking international exposure, and stimulating European co-production and programming.</p>             <p>The 3 selected platforms offer an excellent laboratory to observe and test best practices for the promotion of new and emerging artists, the development and creation of impactful brands, and the production of European and artistic content. They now cover 26 out of the 38 current participating countries (from North or to South Europe as well as the Balkans and central and Eastern Europe) and work in 6 cultural and creative fileds: music, literature, dance, artistic creation in public space, architecture and design, and visual arts.</p>"
