        "<p>This year, a total of 270 applications have been received, submitted by both organisations and individuals. Applications came in from a total of 33 countries, the largest number since the award's creation in 2002. The prize is backed by Creative Europe, the EU's programme to support the European cultural and audio-visual sectors.</p>             <p>The prizes on offer are divided into four categories: conservation, research, dedicated service to heritage conservation and education, training and awareness-raising projects in the heritage sector.</p>             <p>Conservation projects are strongly represented among this year's applications, with 132 projects submitted. 78 applications were received concerning and education, training and awareness-raising projects in cultural heritage. For the other categories, 39 research and digitisation projects were submitted and there are 21 potential awardees for dedicated service to the heritage sector.</p>             <h5>Where applications came from</h5>             <p>What is most impressive this time around, however, is the geographical span of the applications received. The number of applications that came in from Central and Eastern Europe increased massively; with projects from Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro, among others, all now under consideration for the prizes.</p>             <p>Italy is home to the greatest number of applications at 49, closely followed by Spain at 41. Next comes the United Kingdom, with 19 projects potentially up for awards.</p>             <p>The final number of winners could be as high as 30 and these will be announced jointly by the European Commission and Europa Nostra in mid-April.</p>             <p>Awards juries will decide which projects will be acknowledged as having accomplished the most significant and remarkable work in the service of Europe's cultural heritage.</p>             <h5>Award ceremony 11 June</h5>             <p>A high-profile ceremony will be held on 11 June at the Olso City Hall, Norway, for the winners. The ceremony will include an artistic performance and heritage professionals, volunteers and support from across Europe will be among the invitees.</p>             <p>The President of Europa Nostra, Maestro Plácido Domingo, and the European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth and Sport, Tibor Navracsics, will present the awards on the night. A Public Choice Award, decided by an online poll, and the 7 Grand Prix laureates will also be announced at the ceremony.</p>"
