        "<p>                <strong>A year begins</strong>             </p>             <p>Illumination was the theme of the evening. Conceived as a very festive and grand opening, the launch showcased Mons' most beautiful and attractive features. From immersive installations to fireworks displays, glittering parades and a huge concert that lasted all night long, there was a huge range of events on offer across the city.</p>             <p>Illumination is also the focus of the first season of <a href=\"http://www.mons2015.eu/fr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mons 2015 website\">Mons 2015</a> that spans from January to March. Highlights are set to include the exhibition \"<a href=\"http://www.mons2015.eu/fr/vincent-van-gogh-%C3%A0-mons\" target=\"_blank\">Van Gogh in the Borinage – The birth of an artist</a>\", open until 17 May, and the <a href=\"http://www.mons2015.eu/fr/festival\" target=\"_blank\"                   title=\"VIA International Festival\">VIA International Festival</a>, that mixes performing arts and new technologies, on show from 13 to 25 March.</p>             <p>The impressive Sainte-Waudru Collegiale hosted the official part of the opening.

Bringing people together around the core values of the European Union through the universal language of art and culture remains central to the European Capital of Culture.</p>             <p>                <strong>Mons transformed</strong>             </p>             <p>Mons' Mayor Elio di Rupo emphasised the European dimension of the event and how it plays part of a wider strategy to transform the Hainaut region into a digital valley. The aim is to provide the region's inhabitants with renewed pride and hope.</p>             <p>With over 300 events and a thousand cultural and artistic activities – including some in unusual public spaces –, five new museums, two new concert halls, as well as new types of civil participation and innovative digital opportunities, Mons 2015 will reinvent the city and intends to connect art and technology.</p>             <p>Mons shares the European Capital of Culture title with <a href=\"http://www.plzen2015.cz/en/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pilsen 2015 website\">Pilsen</a>.
