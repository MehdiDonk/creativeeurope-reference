        "<p>Being shortlisted for the title can result in significant cultural, economic and social benefits for the cities concerned, provided that their bid is part of a longer-term culture-led development strategy.</p>             <p>Once the panel's recommendation has been confirmed by the European Commission, the shortlisted cities have until next autumn to complete their applications. The panel will then meet again in Brussels, most probably in October 2016, to recommend which city will be European Capital of Culture in 2021. The Commission will then formally designate this city.</p>             <p>In 2021, there will also be two other European Capitals of Culture, one in Romania and one in Greece. The pre-selection meeting for the Romanian competition took place on 7-10 December with four cities being recommended for the final round (Baia Mare, Bucharest, Cluj and Timisoara). The pre-selection round in Greece will take part in late February 2016.</p>             <p>Following <a href=\"http://www.mons2015.eu/en\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mons 2015 website\">Mons (Belgium)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.plzen2015.cz/en/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Plzen 2015 website\">Plzen (Czech Republic)</a> this year, <a href=\"http://www.wroclaw.pl/en/european-capital-of-culture-2016\"                   target=\"_blank\"                   title=\"Wrocław  2016 website\">Wrocław (Poland)</a> and <a href=\"http://dss2016.eu/en/?view=default\" target=\"_blank\"                   title=\"Donostia-San Sebastián  2016 website\">Donostia-San Sebastián (Spain)</a> will be European Capitals of Culture in 2016, Aarhus (Denmark) and Paphos (Cyprus) in 2017, Leeuwarden (Netherlands) and Valletta (Malta) in 2018, and Matera (Italy) and Plovdiv (Bulgaria) in 2019.
