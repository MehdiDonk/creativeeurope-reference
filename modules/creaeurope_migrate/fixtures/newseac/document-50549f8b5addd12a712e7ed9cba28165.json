In this way, the awards are helping to address the linguistic barriers that sometimes make it difficult for European artists to work internationally, despite the fact that language diversity contributes greatly to Europe's cultural appeal. </p>             <p>The awards, which began in 2004, are co-funded by the EU Creative Europe Programme. Since 2009, they are run by <a href=\"http://www.eurosonic-noorderslag.nl/en/\" target=\"_blank\"                   title=\"Eurosonic Noorderslag website\">Eurosonic Noorderslag</a>, an organisation that encourages major music festivals to book hot new talents in Europe; in partnership with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), Buma Cultuur, SNN, the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, Province and City of Groningen, and Music Week.</p>             <p>The ten winners are selected by market analyst Nielsen Music Control on the basis of sales and broadcast frequency, as well as votes cast by European Broadcasting Union radio stations and several European music festivals. One of the winners receives the Public Choice Award based on votes cast on the <a href=\"http://www.europeanborderbreakersawards.eu/eng\">EBBA website</a> from early December to early January.</p>             <p>The <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/opportunities/index_en.htm\"                   lang=\"en\"                   title=\"EU programme for culture and audio-visual sectors\">Creative Europe programme</a> offers EU funding to the cultural and creative sectors.
