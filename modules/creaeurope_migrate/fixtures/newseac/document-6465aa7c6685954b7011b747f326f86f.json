        "<p>Canals, mines, breweries, potteries, forges, railways, cotton mills tell us as much about our heritage as celebrated archelogical sites, cathedrals and castles.</p>             <p>This year Europe has come together to examine our shared past through the unique lens of our industrial heritage, with more than 30 countries joining this common theme.</p>             <p>Throughout Europe we can see the remains of our industrial past: bridges, canals and railways, still in use today, making invaluable contributions to our economy.</p>             <p>However, in most countries there are signs of long-gone industry – a derelict mill, a rusting machine, a brick chimney - all marking the sites of a once-thriving workplace and community.</p>             <p>Our industrial past tells the story of change, development and creativity. It tells the stories of how and where we worked, the kinds of jobs we did and how we lived.</p>             <p>From the end of August to the end of September, people across Europe will visit thousands of sites for free, most of them only open to the public during European Heritage Days.</p>             <p>With over 20 million people participating in over 50000 heritage events, European Heritage Days is a fantastic opportunity to shine a light on the historic economic links Europeans share through the vast legacy of industrial heritage sites.</p>             <p>Cultural heritage is a priority under Creative Europe.
