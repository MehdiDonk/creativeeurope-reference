As Serbians make up one of Vienna's biggest expat communities today, the event's choice of subject matter is a pertinent one. The festival, entitled <strong>Serbischer November</strong> (Serbian November), had the aim of giving visibility to the new generation of Serbian theatremakers and the topics it has been able to freely deal with, after Tito, the war and Milošević. However, other conflict zones, and not strictly Serbian ones, were also highlighted, including the current disagreements among EU member states about the refugee crisis.</p>             <p>                <strong>Serbischer November</strong> was the Volkstheater's first gesture as part of the Conflict Zones project. Other showcases with the project have included the TERRORisms Festival, an international collaboration between Schauspiel Stuttgart (Germany), the National Theatre of Oslo (Norway), the Yugoslav Drama Theatre Belgrade (Serbia), the Habima – National Theatre of Tel Aviv (Israel) and the Comédie de Reims (France). Five plays confronting the theme of terrorism through different perspectives were written for the project and are available to <a href=\"http://www.union-theatres-europe.eu/UNIQ145016756504228/en/terrorisms_e_book\"                   title=\"TERRORisms eBook\">download for free</a>.</p>             <p>The project also has a focus on stimulating the exchange of knowledge about the European theatre sector, while simultaneously supporting the learning and mobility of journalists at the beginning of their careers. The 'Young European Journalists on performing Arts' segment of the Conflict Zones project gives young people the chance to write about performances, hold interviews and capture the essence of this project between politics and arts. Their articles are available in the <a href=\"http://conflict-zones.reviews/\" target=\"_blank\"                   title=\"Interviews and articles in the Conflict Zones E-Zine\">Conflict Zones E-Zine</a>.</p>             <p>Conflict Zones runs until 2017 and many more festivals, productions, conferences, round tables and other events will be taking place during this period so make sure you catch one if you get the chance.
