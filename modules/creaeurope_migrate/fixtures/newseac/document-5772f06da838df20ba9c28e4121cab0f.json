        "<p>The opening gathered over 25 000 people who could enjoy the one hour \"Symphony of Bells\" programme - a mixture of sound, light, film and artistic performance. <br/>                <br/>The event culminated in the first sounding of the bells of the Pilsen Cathedral, accompanied by the bells of eleven former capitals of culture, seven Czech cities and other European cities. Two fires and two wars destroyed the bells of St. Bartholomew’s Cathedral during its history. The group of bells now installed in the tower is the fifth in the series.<br/>                <br/>The opening programme continued with music performance of several well-known artists and bands originating from Pilsen.</p>             <p>                <strong>Economic importance of cultural creation</strong>             </p>             <p>The official part of the opening took place in the impressive building of the new Pilsen theatre.
