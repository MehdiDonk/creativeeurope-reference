        "<p>The award was the icing on the cake for Creative Europe's MEDIA sub-programme at Cannes - the festival featured a record 25 MEDIA-backed films this time around.</p>             <p>Dheepan tells the story of three Tamil refugees who flee the Sri Lankan civil war to the Paris suburbs, only to find further trouble and violence awaiting them.</p>             <p>The lead role, Dheepan, is a former Tamil Tiger who together with a young woman and an unaccompanied child, reinvents his past to secure asylum in Europe.</p>             <p>Dheepan received distribution support from the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/opportunities/audiovisual-support/index_en.htm\"                   lang=\"en\"                   title=\"MEDIA sub-programme explained\">MEDIA sub-programme</a> of Creative Europe. MEDIA distribution support helps films penetrate across national borders and achieve wider success across Europe and beyond.</p>             <h5>More success for MEDIA</h5>             <p>Certain extraordinary individual performances at the festival also received accolades. The Best Actress award was shared between Rooney in <strong>Carol </strong>and Emmanuelle Bercot, starring in <strong>Mon Roi</strong>.</p>             <p>Both of these films, by Todd Haynes and Maïwenn respectively, received MEDIA support and were among the festival's highlights this year.</p>             <p>The Jury Prize, also made from the official selection, went to Yorgos Lanthimos's <strong>The Lobster</strong> – a dystopian work set in the near future that contemplates modern society's infatuation with relationships.</p>             <p>In the Un Certain Regard section, dedicated to original and different works, Dalibor Matanic's <strong>Zvizdan (The High Sun)</strong> took the Jury Prize.</p>             <h5>Independent awards</h5>             <p>MEDIA-backed films also claimed various awards in some of Cannes's parallel sections.<br/>• Nanni Moretti's <strong>Mia Madre (My Mother)</strong> won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury.<br/>• <strong>Jag Är Ingrid (Ingrid Bergman - In Her Own Words)</strong>, a documentary on the life of great Swedish actress received the Special Mention from the L'Œil d'or Jury.<br/>• From the Queer Palm Jury, the overall Jury Prize-winner, <strong>The Lobster</strong>, also gained a Special Mention and <strong>Carol</strong> received the main Queer Palm Award.<br/>• For the Palm Dog Jury, an off-beat and slightly tongue-in-cheek prize for the best canine performances, Bob (the dog from <strong>The Lobster</strong>) and Lucky from <strong>As mil e uma noites (Arabian Nights)</strong> both received awards.</p>             <p>So in all in all, the 68th annual Cannes Film Festival can be considered a resounding success for Creative Europe and the MEDIA sub-programme with a record 25 films on show and a MEDIA-backed film stealing the show with the prestigious Palme D'Or award – roll on Cannes 2016.</p>"
