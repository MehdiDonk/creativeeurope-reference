Where is it being filmed and when will it be screened?</h5>             <p>It's being filmed right now in Malmö and the rest of the southern part of Sweden, Skåne, and in Denmark, mainly Copenhagen, so we are right now in the middle of the shooting actually. We have been shooting the first four episodes so far and we are going to continue with the remaining six in the spring. We’re going to be finished in mid-May and then it is going to be shown in the fall some time and maybe spring outside the Nordic countries.</p>             <h5>So, basically, late 2015 and early 2016. People who followed the first two series will be able to catch up on what's happened to the stars. Will it feature the previous stars, Sofia Helin and Kim Bodnia?</h5>             <p>Sofia [Saga] will still have the leading role in this Season 3. But with Kim, the role he plays, Martin, is convicted for murder that is the last thing that happened in the 2nd season. He is going to be in jail and is not going to show up this season. We have some new interesting characters coming in. It is going to be really interesting to see how that comes out…</p>             <h5>Will you have a male lead similar to Martin's character in Season 1 and 2?</h5>             <p>Something like it, but it's going to be a bit different. It's going to start a bit different. Not spoiling too much for the audience I will not tell you that much more about it right now. There will be some new Danish actors coming in that will have leading roles for the upcoming season.</p>             <br/>             <div id=\"mediaspace\">Loading the player...</div>             <script type=\"text/javascript\">//  //  //          jwplayer('mediaspace').setup({             file: \"http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/gallery/videos/bridge-trailer-s2_en.mp4\",             image: \"http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/gallery/videos_thumbnails/bridge-trailer-s2.jpg\",             title:\"The Bridge - Season 2 trailer\",             autostart: \"false\",             width:'100%',             height:342,             controlbar:\"over\"           }); // </script>             <p>Trailer from Season 2</p>             <h5>Does that mean you will continue with what you did in the previous two series where the dialogue's in Swedish and Danish?</h5>             <p>Absolutely: it's going to be half-Swedish, half-Danish. We try to tell stories that take place equally in Sweden as in Denmark and half of the actors will be Swedish and the other half will be Danish, we keep on with that.</p>             <h5>The first two series were enormously successful. How many countries worldwide actually took the first two series? Do you expect interest in Season 3 to be similarly high?</h5>             <p>Yes absolutely. So far we have sold the first two seasons to around 160 countries all over the world. I expect Season 3 will be as big as the first two seasons. It seems the interest is very high still.</p>             <h5>The Bridge is a co-production between Filmlance in Sweden and Nimbus Film in Denmark: how, for the uninitiated, does this co-production work in practice? Is it a 50-50 project or does one company take the lead?</h5>             <p>We have the lead function in Filmlance running this project. We have to stick to one country's rules and regulations. People are employed by Filmlance and by Swedish laws and regulations but we are filming and shooting in both countries. Most of it is going to be shot in Malmö in south of Sweden - even interiors and stuff that should look like Copenhagen. We ‘cheat’ because the production centre is located in Malmö.</p>             <h5>So there's a little bit of Copenhagen in the south of Sweden …</h5>             <p>I do not think anyone can see actually where we cheat and shoot scenes in Malmö instead of Copenhagen. Of course when it comes to more well-known locations and surroundings, we do it in Copenhagen.</p>             <div class=\"contextual-box-right\">                <h3>MEDIA backs top TV drama</h3>                <ul>                   <li>The third season of The Bridge received € 1 million from the Creative Europe MEDIA programme under a new action line for high quality, high budget (€ 10 million+) European TV drama series.</li>                   <li>Four European TV production companies were each awarded € 1 million under this action in 2014: Haut et Court TV (France) for Les Revenants Season 2, Warp Films Ltd (UK) for Barbarians: The Last of the Pink Panthers, Spotless Productions Ltd (UK) for Spotless, and Filmlance International for The Bridge Season 3.</li>                   <li>The Bridge also had €400 000 from the MEDIA programme in 2010.</li>                </ul>             </div>             <h5>The new season of the Bridge has received € 1 million from the EU's Creative Europe MEDIA programme. How important is this funding for the production and how is it used?</h5>             <p>It is extremely important for us. We actually got a smaller funding [from MEDIA] for the first season; if we would not have received that then I do not think we would have managed to pull it off from the beginning. It is so important because it means that we can take down our risks and our investments in season 3 and have some money that we can spend on developing new things, new projects and so on. So it’s really, really important for us the support we have received from MEDIA.</p>             <h5>That’s good to hear. Scandinavian TV, film and literature are more popular than ever: some would even describe it as a 'golden age'. What do you put this success down to? Is it a sort of 'Scandi-fad' or is it the result of investment in training through film schools etc?</h5>             <p>It is interesting. There is a trend now and we’re really strong in film, even music and literature and so on. I think there are, or might be, a couple of reasons [for Scandinavia’s success]: I think we are quite good at understanding and adapting what we’re doing to what the audience really wants to have. Another thing is maybe that since we haven’t had great budgets for our projects, we haven’t been able to go on just doing action things and so on because we cannot do it. We have instead been trying to do really good character drama and I think that is really what interests people mostly, to see what happens to our characters. That’s what stays in your heart when you turn on your TV screen. I think that might be a reason that we have chosen that way of story-telling here.</p>             <div class=\"img-align-left\">                <img src=\"http://ec.europa.eu/news/images/thumbnails-producer.jpg\"                     alt=\"Producer of The Bridge Anders Landström\"                     title=\"Producer of The Bridge Anders Landström\"/>                <p>Producer of The Bridge Anders Landström</p>             </div>             <h5>In terms of 'telling stories' and character drama, are you influenced by the current Swedish-Danish-Scandinavian scene in television and film or are your influences more from the past and not only from Scandinavia?</h5>             <p>I think we are influenced a lot of course by what is done in the rest of Europe and in the rest of the world. We get to see so much from all over now; it is so easy to see brilliant series and features from the rest of Europe and the US, so I think the influence is coming a lot from abroad but also from what we have done earlier. We are building on to what has been done earlier here in Scandinavia. I think it is both actually.</p>             <h5>Anders, I really appreciate you taking your time to speak to us. Best of luck with season 3. I am looking forward to seeing it in autumn next year.</h5>             <p>It is going to be so great to keep on working with it and show it to the audience in the autumn.</p>             <em>Interview by Dennis Abbott</em>             <br/>             <br/>             <br/>"
