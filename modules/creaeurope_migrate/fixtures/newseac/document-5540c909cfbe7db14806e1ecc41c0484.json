Lauded in the press, as well as being an artistic triumph, the production relied on local amateurs from every city it visited for acting, staging and for the development of the piece.</p>             <p style=\"text-align: left;\">From May 2013 to December 2015, 17370 people witnessed unique performance of Van den vos. The performances achieved a 'disarming genuineness and authenticity' in every city it visited thanks to the local volunteers engaged in making the piece. (see <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/proxy/alfresco-webscripts/api/node/content/workspace/SpacesStore/9507cd1f-bb45-46e9-afe1-718b8a81c541/upload9_Van%20den%20vos_EN_150513.pdf#page=13\"                   target=\"_blank\"                   title=\"Project description\">programme</a>)</p>             <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Van den vos premiered in Antwerp, Belgium, in 2013 before going on tour in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and 's-Hertogenbosch in Netherlands, Berlin, Germany, Valenciennes, France, and Vienna, Austria. The ambition of the piece that combined live music, composed by the German ensemble Kaleidoskop, a substantial set and the running of parallel volunteers workshops meant that European support was crucial to bringing Van den vos to audiences across different countries. <a href=\"https://toneelhuis.be/en/post/music-rehearsals-van-den-vos-berlin\"                   target=\"_blank\"                   title=\"Music rehearsals for Van den vos in Berlin\">Watch the Kaleidoscope ensemble rehearse for Van den vos</a>.</p>             <blockquote>                <p>\"Call Van den vos a live film in 3D if you like, but it is theatre as theatre is meant to be. It stands in the midst of society and summons up its deeper paradoxes.\" Wouter Hillaert in De Standaard 07/12/2013</p>             </blockquote>             <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The piece was directed by FC Bergman, the Flemish theatre company. In each city the piece visited, 7 volunteers were given an acting masterclass and joined the show as extras. In a cooperation between theatres in Brussels and Vienna, 96 young people were involved in workshops working on the themes of the play, mythology and evil, and developed their own reinterpretations of the plot.<img src=\"http://ec.europa.eu/news/images/van-den-vos.png\" align=\"right\"                     alt=\"Van den vos \"                     height=\"241\"                     style=\"margin-top: 6px;\"                     title=\"Van den vos \"                     width=\"170\"/>             </p>             <p style=\"text-align: left;\">In Brussels, Vienna, Berlin and Rotterdam, public talks were held after the performances giving the audience a chance to react to what they had just experienced. In Belgium, Van den vos inspired two amateur adaptions that were watched by 688 people. Both theatre troupes received workshops on acting and directing to encourage the development of their productions.</p>             <p style=\"text-align: left;\">These kinds of activities helped pull this theatre production off the stage and bring culture into the lives of everyone involved: audiences, volunteers and wider communities.</p>             <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/projects/ce-project-details-page/?nodeRef=workspace://SpacesStore/b697e5ef-8fdc-473b-8041-0fc7382cad1c\"                   target=\"_blank\"                   title=\"Full details and results of the project\">Van den vos (About Reynard the Fox)</a> project ran from May 2013 to December 2014 and was funded by the Culture Programme (now part of Creative Europe).
