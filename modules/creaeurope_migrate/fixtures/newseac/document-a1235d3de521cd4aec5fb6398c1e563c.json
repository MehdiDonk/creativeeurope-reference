        "<p>\"My congratulations to the Director and Scriptwriter, the Producers and the team behind Ida for their well-deserved Oscar triumph. It has been a pleasure to follow the success of this Polish-Danish post-war drama by Paweł Pawlikowski. In December, Ida won no less than five European Film Awards, including the People's Choice Award and Best European Film. This has been followed by across the board success, including the European Parliament Lux Film Prize awarded to Ida as a celebration of European films and European values and diversity\" says Lucia Recalde, Head of the MEDIA Unit at the European Commission.</p>             <p>The MEDIA sub-programme is proud of its support for Ida - the film received backing from no less than three of MEDIA's support schemes which contributed to both the development and the cross-border circulation of the film. Ida is an outstanding example of great European creativity and quality in filmmaking that can reach out to the hearts and minds of audiences everywhere.</p>             <h5>Six nominations</h5>             <p>And Ida is not alone. European films deserve recognition despite the challenges currently facing the audiovisual sector. Six of 2015's Oscar-nominated films were granted support by the EU's Creative Europe MEDIA sub-programme. Mike Leigh's Mr. Turner was nominated in four categories and Wim Wenders' and Juliano Ribeiro Salgado's The Salt of the Earth was recognised in the Best Documentary category. The Irish Song of the Seas was nominated in the Best Animation category and Marion Cottillard was nominated as Best Actress in Two Days, One Night.</p>             <p>\"Last but not least I would like to congratulate Abderramane Sissako - also nominated for a Foreign Language Oscar - on Timbuktu's triumph at the 2015 Cesar Awards, winning seven prizes, including best film and best director\" Lucia Recalde adds.</p>             <p> </p>"
