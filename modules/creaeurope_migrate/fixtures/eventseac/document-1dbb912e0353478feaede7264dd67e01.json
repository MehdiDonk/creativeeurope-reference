        "<h4>04.07. &gt; 04.10.2015 Fervent China</h4>             <p>Chinese Monumental Sculptures - Exhibition Former Slaughterhouse<br/>                <br/>More than ever this summer, the sun will rise in the East! Twenty-five iconic sculptures originally from China, on loan from collections in New York and Europe, will form a magnificent series in the space of the Former Slaughterhouse.</p>             <p>Different subjects have been developed, throughout monumental masterpieces or on the contrary very fragile works, from traditional themes like landscapes, nature and our ecological challenges, questioning mega-urbanization or even femininity in contemporary art.</p>             <p>Traditional Chinese subjects, such as the Phoenix, the mythical bird with the power to be cyclically reborn by arising from its own ashes, are deconstructing and reinterpreting the shapes of art history or the representation of humans to remodel through the new imagination of Chines cultural re-identification and its relationship with the global artistic context.</p>             <h4>17.07. &gt; 26.07.15 - Sun City</h4>             <p>Sunflower Maze - Art in the City Grand Place<br/>                <br/>Four gems from UNESCO’s World Heritage list, fifteen urban installations, twenty-five contemporary sculptures from China and an exhibition of artists who have devised the ideal city.</p>             <p>If you’re into the performing arts, check out Mons' festivals! There’s the Festival au Carré with everything from Sophocles to Arno. Then there’s the indie Dour Music Festival (which is organizing an extra evening specially for Mons 2015), plus La Ville enchantée, a hymn to a new kind of circus and having fun as a family. And there’s the Festin of Mons artists, and Mr Zo’s 400 coups.</p>             <p>If a cool ambiance is your thing, drop in and enjoy a good read at the Guinguette, talk to the world at Café Europa, and chill at the Maison Folie’s blue beach or in the Hanging Garden.</p>             <h4>04.04. &gt; 21.09.2015 Fifteen Urban Installations</h4>             <p>A City Transformed - Art in the City throughout the City</p>             <p>Set off with the family to discover Mons. The city will not be quite the same! Fifteen urban installations will spice up your visit until September. A cascade of books, spurious ads, frescos and other work by activists in action, sloths sleeping in trees, menhirs made of the local brick, a poetic phrase which runs across ten kilometers of streets and building fronts... (re)discover Mons!</p>"
