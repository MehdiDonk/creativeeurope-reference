        "<p>The event is promoted by the <a href=\"http://www.bespectactive.eu/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link to project\">Be SpecACTive! project</a> and it is the ambitious development of its focus on audience engagement and active spectatorship. Across Be SpectACTive! network, made up of twelve members in nine European countries, different groups of active spectators came to existence last year to take part in the programming of theatre and cultural organizations of their cities: one hundred people have been involved so far in this process of active spectatorship.</p>             <p>The European Spectators day will be the first attempt to put these active spectators in contact, trying to bypass linguistic barriers and distance by mean of new communication tools and social media. “The European Spectators Day comes from the necessity to connect the local areas in which our spectators are based – said Giuliana Ciancio and Luca Ricci, creators and curators of Be SpectACTive! - The 2015 edition is a starting point that hopefully will become a fix appointment in the coming editions. Our aim is to connect spectators across nations and give them the occasion to share their experience in theatre and create a trans-local community”. It is the first time an active spectatorship experiment will take place on the larger European scale.</p>             <p>A number of initiatives will take place in each city during the European Spectators Day: from London to Budapest, passing through Sansepolcro, all Be SpectACTive! members will have their spectators meeting at the same time, trying to share their views with the ones of other countries. Active spectators will also fill in a short form about their visions and approaches to theatre and contemporary performing arts: their answers (to the same three questions) will be made public on the 21st November, making concrete the possibility of a live conversation among European spectators.</p>             <p>The timing of the event would slightly differs across countries due to lag reasons: the European Spectators Day will begin at 6pm in London, 7pm in Central Europe and 8pm in Romania. This is to concentrate all the activities at one time and making a unique, coordinated, European event instead than just a multitude of local ones.</p>             <p>Be SpectACTive! is a project financed by Creative Europe. Its members are: Municipality of Sansepolcro and CapoTrave/Kilowatt (Italy), Bakelit Multi Arts Center (Hungary), B51 Cultural Society (Slovenia), Domino (Croatia), LIFT (UK), Radu Stanca National Theatre (Romania), Tanec Praha (Czech Republic), York Theatre Royal (UK). Research aspects followed by: Fitzcarraldo Foundation (Italy), University of Barcelona (Spain), University of Montpellier (France).</p>"
