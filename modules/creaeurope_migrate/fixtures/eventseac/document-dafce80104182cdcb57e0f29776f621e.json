Now, it is time to discuss with you such findings and develop together direct recommendations to the European Commission: <br/>                <br/>•   Is there a lack of entrepreneurial and technical skills in the CCIs?<br/>•   Which \"capacity building schemes\" can help to overcome it?<br/>•   Does innovative use of technology creates scalability for the CCIs? <br/>•   How can we create collaborative environments for ICT and CCI professionals?<br/>•   Which are the financing needs of the CCIs? <br/>•   Which accelerator schemes can cover their needs?</p>             <h5>Participation</h5>             <p>                <a href=\"https://coaching.at-diversity.eu/pages/final-seminar/\">                   <b>Apply now for a place at The Creative Shift Forum</b>                </a>                <b>- </b>deadline: 9 September 2014</p>"
