In this context, the results of the first generation have been published and a <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/culture/events/2014/20140516-cannes-audiovisual_en.htm\"                   lang=\"en\"                   title=\"Proceeds of the Canes conference on EU audiovisual policy\">public presentation took place in Cannes on 16/05/2014</a>.</p>             <h5>                <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/tools/\" id=\"so-far\"/>What has been achieved so far?</h5>             <p>The first generation of projects has been implemented, with the results published in a <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/culture/library/studies/cinema-diversity-report_en.pdf\"                   lang=\"en\"                   target=\"_blank\"                   title=\"Study on new approaches for greater diversity of cinema\">report analysing the experiments</a> (accompanied by an <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/culture/library/studies/cinema-diversity-summary_en.pdf\"                   lang=\"en\"                   target=\"_blank\"                   title=\"Executive summary of the study on new approaches for greater diversity of cinema\">executive summary</a>).

The report also highlighted that no major risks to the approach existed notably in terms of potential cannibalisation between the several platforms of exploitation (e.g. cinemas and VOD).</p>             <h5>                <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/tools/\" id=\"next\"/>What are the next steps?</h5>             <p>Following on from the report on the first generation of projects, the second generation of projects are releasing new films and the results of the experimentation will be published and shared with market players and policy makers.</p>             <p>The second generation of projects consist of:</p>             <ul>                <li>                   <strong>Simultaneous Picture European Exploitation in a Digital Bunch</strong> (SPIDE), a merger of TIDE and Speed Bunch coordinated by ARP,</li>                <li>                   <a href=\"https://www.filmfestivalrotterdam.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\"                      title=\"Website of the International Film Festival Rotterdam\">International Film Festival Rotterdam</a> (IFFR) Live, coordinated by The Rotterdam Film Festival, and</li>                <li>                   <a href=\"http://www.streamsdayanddate.com/\" target=\"_blank\"                      title=\"Website of the Streams Day and Date project\">Streams Day &amp; Date</a>, coordinated by Eurovod.</li>             </ul>             <p>The reporting should include, where possible, considerations on the relationship between theatrical release and digital distribution, synergies between traditional and new marketing, and the effect of increasing the multi-territorial dimension of the distribution.</p>"
