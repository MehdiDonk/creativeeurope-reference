The conference will be the opportunity to discover the potential of co-creation and co-programming between artists and the public. It will also be the occasion to discuss about the results of the first months of activities by Be SpectACTive!: the methodology applied by researchers and performers will be disseminated and new organisations, wishing to improve their strategies of active spectatorship, will have the opportunity to take part in the discussion. </p>             <h4>The project</h4>             <p>Be SpectACTive! is a European project based on audience development, which encourages intercultural dialogue through practices exchange amongst professionals, artists and audiences all across Europe. Its members are: Municipality of Sansepolcro and CapoTrave/Kilowatt (Italy), Bakelit Multi Arts Center (Hungary), B51 Cultural Society (Slovenia), Domino (Croatia), LIFT (UK), Radu Stanca National Theatre (Romania), Tanec Praha (Czech Republic), York Theatre Royal (UK). Research aspects are followed by: Fitzcarraldo Foundation (Italy), University of Barcelona (Spain), University of Montpellier (France). Be SpectACTive! aims to build an international, production-oriented and sustainable network involving the most innovative European organisations working on active spectatorship. Be SpectACTive! is co-funded by the Creative Europe programme of European Union.</p>"
