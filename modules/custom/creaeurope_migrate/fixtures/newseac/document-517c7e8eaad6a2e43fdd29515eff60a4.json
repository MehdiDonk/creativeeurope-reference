        "<p>The laureates will be designated and celebrated in 2016. The European Heritage Label is a European Union initiative that raises awareness of sites significant to Europe's history, culture and development.</p>             <p>The proposals were submitted by all member states (except Ireland, Finland , UK and Sweden) as part of the 2015 selection process. Each country can pre-select up to two sites of which one may be awarded the label.</p>             <p>The following pre-selected sites were submitted to the Commission with a view to the final selection:</p>             <ul>                <li>The Congress Hall at the Federal Chancellery of Austria (Austria)</li>                <li>The Imperial Palace of Vienna (Austria)</li>                <li>Mundaneum (Belgium)</li>                <li>The Adolf Loos interiors in Pilsen (Czech Republic)</li>                <li>The Olomouc Museum of Art - Archdiocesan Museum Olomouc (Czech Republic)</li>                <li>Krapina Neanderthal Museum and the prehistoric site of Neanderthal man Husnjakovo (Croatia)</li>                <li>Industrial heritage of the city of Rijeka (Croatia)</li>                <li>The historic ensemble of the University of Tartu (Estonia)</li>                <li>Strasbourg and its European quarter (France)</li>                <li>Franz Liszt Academy of Music, Budapest (Hungary)</li>                <li>Royal Palace of Visegrad (Hungary)</li>                <li>The Holy Cross and Brother Mansueto from Castiglione, an ambassador to the courts of Europe (Italy)</li>                <li>Castle of Canossa (Italy)</li>                <li>Luzna - Pustki wartime cemetery (Poland)</li>                <li>Industrialisation in Upper Silesia (Poland)</li>                <li>Sagres Point, Algarve (Portugal)</li>                <li>Mertola Vila Museu (Portugal)</li>                <li>Schunck Glass Palace, Heerlen (The Netherlands)</li>             </ul>             <p>The procedure for awarding sites consists of two stages. Sites are proposed by countries and then a final selection is carried out by a European Panel of independent experts, under the responsibility of the Commission.</p>             <p>The panel will assess the sites using the criteria laid down for the label. Most important for a site's selection is its European significance and the activities that it has planned to highlight its European dimension.</p>             <p>The panel will issue its report by the end of 2015. The Commission designates the sites to be awarded the label on the basis of the panel's recommendation.</p>"
